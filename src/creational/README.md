# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

## Overview

Creational patterns focus on:
- Object creation mechanisms
- Flexibility in deciding which objects to create
- Hiding the complexity of object creation
- Ensuring a system is independent of how its objects are created

## Patterns in this Category

### [Factory Pattern](factory/README.md)
Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### [Builder Pattern](builder/README.md)
Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### [Singleton Pattern](singleton/README.md)
Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Common Use Cases

Creational patterns are particularly useful when:
- You need to create objects without specifying their exact classes
- You want to ensure a class has only one instance
- You need to build complex objects step by step
- You want to control object creation and lifecycle
- You need to create families of related objects

## Benefits

- Increased flexibility in deciding which objects to create
- Encapsulation of object creation logic
- Control over object lifecycle
- Reduced coupling between classes
- Better code organization and maintainability

## When to Use

Consider using creational patterns when:
1. You need to create objects without specifying their exact classes
2. You want to ensure a class has only one instance
3. You need to build complex objects step by step
4. You want to control object creation and lifecycle
5. You need to create families of related objects
6. You want to hide the complexity of object creation
7. You need to ensure proper initialization of objects

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing creational patterns, consider:
- The flexibility needed in object creation
- The complexity of the objects being created
- The need for object lifecycle management
- The coupling between classes
- The performance implications of object creation
- The need for object pooling or caching
- The thread safety requirements
