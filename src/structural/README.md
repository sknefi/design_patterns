# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure doesn't need to change.

## Overview

Structural patterns focus on:
- How classes and objects are composed
- The relationships between objects
- The flexibility of object structures
- The interface between different parts of a system

## Patterns in this Category

### [Adapter Pattern](adapter/README.md)
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate by converting the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect.

### [Facade Pattern](facade/README.md)
Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes, subsystems, or frameworks.

## Common Use Cases

Structural patterns are particularly useful when:
- You need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- You want to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- You need to make incompatible interfaces work together
- You want to compose objects into tree structures
- You need to share objects efficiently

## Benefits

- Improved flexibility in object composition
- Better interface compatibility
- Enhanced code reusability
- Simplified complex subsystems
- Reduced coupling between components
- More maintainable code structure

## When to Use

Consider using structural patterns when:
1. You need to make incompatible interfaces work together
2. You want to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
3. You need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically
4. You want to compose objects into tree structures
5. You need to share objects efficiently
6. You want to reduce the number of classes in a system
7. You need to hide implementation details from clients

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing structural patterns, consider:
- The complexity of the interfaces involved
- The performance implications of the pattern
- The maintainability of the resulting code
- The flexibility needed in the structure
- The coupling between components
- The need for interface compatibility
- The scalability of the solution
