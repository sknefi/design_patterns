# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. These patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them.

## Overview

Behavioral patterns focus on:
- How objects interact and distribute responsibility
- The communication between objects
- The flow of control in a program
- The assignment of responsibilities between objects

## Patterns in this Category

### [Command Pattern](command/README.md)
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

### [Observer Pattern](observer/README.md)
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### [Iterator Pattern](iterator/README.md)
Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### [Strategy Pattern](strategy/README.md)
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Common Use Cases

Behavioral patterns are particularly useful when:
- You need to change the behavior of an object at runtime
- You want to reduce tight coupling between objects
- You need to implement complex communication between objects
- You want to make your code more flexible and reusable

## Benefits

- Improved flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced communication between objects
- More maintainable and extensible code
- Reduced coupling between components

## When to Use

Consider using behavioral patterns when:
1. You need to change the behavior of an object at runtime
2. You want to reduce tight coupling between objects
3. You need to implement complex communication between objects
4. You want to make your code more flexible and reusable
5. You need to implement complex algorithms that might change
6. You want to implement undo/redo functionality
7. You need to implement event handling systems
